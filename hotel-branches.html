                <P> Treehotel is located in the tall pine forest with spectacular views of the Lule River. 
                    The tree rooms are suspended 4-10 metres above the ground and are accessible by ramp, 
                    bridge, or electric stairs. Upon checking in at The Guesthouse, it’s a five-minute walk 
                    to Treehotel. Breakfast, lunch and dinner is served in our Treehotel Guesthouse restaurant. <br> <br>
                    Enjoy delightful breakfasts, leisurely lunches, and memorable dinners in a setting that harmonizes 
                    with the natural wonders that surround you. Your Treehotel stay is a gateway to unforgettable adventures 
                    in the Lapland wilderness.

        <h2> Biosphere</h2>
        <p>  
        Biosphere amplifies Treehotel's focus on sustainability and natural tourism, helping facilitate the conservation of 
        the local bird population. With a façade containing 350 bird nests, Treehotel aims to decrease the downward spiral 
        of the bird population in the Swedish woods and instead strengthen the biosphere and natural habitat. <br> <br>

        The hotel room Biosphere is the latest addition to Treehotel. The 34m Biosphere is designed to attract wildlife 
        and for guests to be fully immersed in the surrounding forest. The room will be open for visitors in June, 2022.

        The interior is simple and pragmatic, yet due to its checker solid-open conceptual make-up, allows for a range of 
        experiences within a relatively small space. Visitors will during our snow free months have access to a roof terrace 
        - close to the treetop canopies - that offer a 360-degree views of the forest. <br> <br>

        Through wrapping the new hotel room in an ecological habitat, guests are provided the opportunity to experience 
        birdlife in close proximity, finding themselves in the epicenter of nature.

<!-- Mirror cube  -->
        <section class = "roomcontent">
            <h2> Mirror cube </h2>
            <p> 
                The Mirrorcube is a truly different tree room, a cube measuring 4x4x4 metres. The room is surrounded by 
                mirror walls which both reflect and blend in with the surroundings.
                A tree trunk grows through the room and is enclosed by an aluminium frame, which forms the base of the room. 
                All walls are covered in mirror glass. <br><br>

                On the outside, this gives the illusion that the room is glass from floor to ceiling. However, on the inside, 
                the walls are light plywood, with windows on three of them as well as on the ceiling. Which is a good thing, 
                because on dark nights when the lights are on, you can actually sense that there is someone moving behind the 
                pieces of mirror glass that are not covered by walls. <br><br>

                Another exciting detail hidden behind the mirror facade is a balcony that allows you to go outside the box without being seen.
                The Mirrorcube is an exciting hide-out among the trees, camouflaged by mirrored walls reflecting their surroundings.
                The base consists of an aluminum frame around the tree trunk and the walls are covered with reflective glass.</p>

<!-- the bird's nest  -->
    <section class = "roomcontent">
    <h2> The Bird's nest </h2>
    <p> The Bird’s nest is built on the contrasts between the outside and inside.
        The treeroom’s exterior is nothing but a gigantic bird’s nest. It gives a camouflage
        so you quickly disappear and become part of the surroundings. <br><br>

        The Bird’s Nest room was created to blend in with the surrounding environment as much as possible. A room for introspection 
        rather than extroversion. Here, you can really become at one with nature and have more time to yourself – in a gigantic treetop 
        bird’s nest that no one else can see into. You climb into the Bird’s Nest via a ladder and through a hatch in the floor. You then 
        close the hatch, leaving the rest of the world outside. <br><br>

        Even though it is a compact room with small windows, it is perceived as remarkably bright, thanks to the interior decor and the 
        windows which both let light in and offer you a way to look out.
        The room is popular amongst families with children, but also suitable for 4 adults. You may want to know that two of the beds 
        are curved to follow the walls.

<!-- the cabin  -->
    <section class = "roomcontent">
    <h2> The cabin </h2>
    <p> The Cabin is one of our most romantic rooms. This double room is shaped like a capsule, on view amongst the trees as you walk 
        up the trail from our main building. Its location has been chosen so as to create a platform at the top of a steep slope overlooking 
        the Lule River valley. As a guest, this gives you a majestic view from the room and also a remarkable entrance. A long bridge leads 
        up from ground level, to a door seemingly hovering in mid-air. <br><br>

        Behind the door lie the alternating tread stairs descending into the room. On top of the room there is a a balcony with seating. 
        Over the years, this is a place that many happy couples have chosen for proposals and even wedding vows. <br><br>
        
        The room hangs in a slightly askew way, underneath the deck. This is done partially to minimise its volume but also to 
        give the room its very own character. Inside the room, the bed is placed at the centre and there are large windows offering 
        a high-altitude view of the forest and the river. By the windows, you will find comfortable seating.</p>

<!-- the ufo  -->
    <h2> The ufo </h2>
    <p>
        The UFO was designed to be the most unexpected thing you can encounter in the forest. And what could possibly be more unexpected 
        than a UFO hovering amongst the trees? The room contrasts sharply with the camouflaged bird’s nest by the same architect, Bertil Harström. <br><br>
        
        The room has been cast in a high-strength composite material in order to create a construction that is light yet as durable as possible.
        Inside the UFO you are taken to a space-inspired world with a starry sky in the ceiling and an interior and textiles designed according to 
        the same theme. The room has small windows which let light in and allow you to look out. Here, you can also feel the UFO move, as it is 
        suspended on wires and beams connected to the trees. <br><br>
        
        The UFO has room for five people, with one double bed and three single beds. It is one of our most popular family rooms, 
        however, it is also suitable for groups of adults, provided that the people sleeping in the single beds are not very tall. <br><br>

        And what could be more different than an UFO?</p>

<!-- dragonfly  -->
    <h2> Dragonfly</h2>
    <p> The Dragonfly is our second-largest room, at 52 sq. m. and 22 tons. The room is primarily used for private accommodation, 
        but can also be used for small conferences of up to 6 participants. Here you will find four beds in two bedrooms, one with 
        a view of the Lule River Valley from the bed and the other facing the calm, wind-whispering forest. <br><br>

        A 15-metre ramp takes you up to the Dragonfly and ends at a small patio outside the door. This too has been the site of many 
        proposals and engagements over the years. <br><br>
        
        Inside the room, large panoramic windows offer a view of the river valley. In some places, the light falls in a way that 
        almost gives you the illusion of being able to touch the trees outside. Even in the bathroom, with its own shower, you have 
        an amazing view of tall pines and the Lule River. <br><br>
        
        All of the Treehotel tree rooms have incinerating toilets and our sustainable Rukkamoinika water system with 3 litres 
        of water for washing your hands.</p>
