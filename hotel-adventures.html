    <h2> The stately Storforsen </h2>
    <p> Come with us to the stately Storforsen, one of the highest unrestricted white-water rapids in Europe. Let yourself be carried away by a hike next to the thundering river and also enjoy the quieter brooks running out between the rocks. There are footbridges in the area allowing everyone to make their way out to the rapids. There is also a forestry and log driving museum here. During the visit, our guide will cook you lunch over an open fire and on hot days you can go for a dip in one of the natural pools formed amongst the rocks.
